## Overview

This project is a **front-end mockup** of an IMDb-like interface—designed in CodePen—with placeholder data to visualize layout, navigation, and user interface components. It’s intended as a design prototype, not a fully functional app.

## Demo


Check out my website on CodePen: [View Website](https://codepen.io/Khansa-Urooj/full/azbyYEr)


## Features

- Responsive layout optimized for desktop and mobile.
- Sample navigation menu (e.g., search bar, movie categories).
- Movie cards displaying poster, title, release year.
- Static detail view layout with sample plot, cast, and ratings.
- Favorites/watchlist UI mock (non-functional in this version).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structure of the UI elements.
- **CSS3** – Styling, layout, and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript** – For basic interactivity (hover effects, tab switches).
- **CodePen** – Live design and prototyping environment.


### Prerequisites

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
- Internet connection to access CodePen.

### Installation & Usage

Since this is a static design:

1. Visit the CodePen link above.
2. Interact with the layout: test responsiveness, hover effects, and design flow.
3. To modify:
   - Click “Edit on CodePen” to fork the pen and customize HTML, CSS, or JS.
   - Save or share your version directly from CodePen.

## How It Was Built

- **Design-first approach**: Focused on user interface visuals before adding functionality.
- **Structural layout**: Organized using semantic HTML, with layout managed via Flexbox or CSS Grid.
- **Responsive design**: Media queries ensure layout adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Static placeholders**: Used dummy images and text; no real API integration yet.


## Future Enhancements

- Integrate real data using APIs like OMDb or TMDB.
- Add search functionality and dynamic movie details.
- Implement favorites or watchlist with `localStorage`.
- Enhance accessibility and add transitions/animations.
- Convert prototype into a full React/Vue application later on.

## Credits

- Inspired by IMDb’s sleek UI design.
- Built with CodePen’s live editor for rapid prototyping.
- Thanks to front-end design communities for layout and best practices.

### How to Use This Template

1. Copy the above Markdown and paste it into your `README.md` file in the repo.
2. Update or fill in sections:
   - Provide the exact CodePen URL in **Demo**.
   - Adjust sections if your design includes actual interactivity or frameworks.
3. Commit and push to GitHub—or better yet, start hosting a live version online!
